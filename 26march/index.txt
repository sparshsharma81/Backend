this is the dummy data file 
client file ka naam kuch bhi daal sakta hai


__dirname and __filename --- when javascript runs it sets two names in memory allocation 


to change the path of filename 
const filepath = __dirname + "/" + filename + ".txt";  --this can change the file path..
but it will cause error in some cases as linux is using forward slash \

so we are using path.join();
 
const filepath = path.join("sparsh","tarandeep","yashsvi","aditya");
console.log(filepath);
--it will automatically add \ in the file path names 


there are 5 types of middleware

1.error handling --sending the error that the developer is generating

2.third party
3.build in
4.route level
5.application level
